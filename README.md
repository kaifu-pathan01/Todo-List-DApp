# Todo List DApp

A decentralized task management system built on blockchain technology that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks in a transparent and immutable manner.

## Project Description

The Todo List DApp is a revolutionary approach to task management that leverages blockchain technology to provide users with a decentralized, transparent, and secure way to manage their daily tasks. Unlike traditional todo applications that rely on centralized servers, this DApp stores all task data on the blockchain, ensuring data permanence, user ownership, and complete transparency.

Built on the Core Blockchain Testnet 2, this application demonstrates the practical implementation of smart contracts for everyday use cases. Users can create tasks, mark them as complete, delete unwanted tasks, and track their productivity metrics all while maintaining complete control over their data.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to transform how people interact with productivity tools by:

- **Democratizing Data Ownership**: Users have complete control over their task data without relying on centralized services
- **Building Trust Through Transparency**: All operations are recorded on the blockchain, providing complete audit trails
- **Creating Universal Accessibility**: Anyone with a Web3 wallet can access their tasks from anywhere in the world
- **Pioneering Decentralized Productivity**: Leading the way in decentralized applications for personal productivity
- **Fostering Innovation**: Providing a foundation for more complex decentralized productivity ecosystems
